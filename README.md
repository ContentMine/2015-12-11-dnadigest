Information for participants of the DNAdigest workshop.
Workshop MozFest 2015
==============================
**Content-Mining for Transparency of Drug Research**

Applying content mining tools to large corpora of scientific texts benefits researchers and the public through increased efficiency and transparency. With playground data from the field of drug trials and the help of ContentMine tools, we will explore how to create and visualize relations between entities, e.g. authors and companies, or drugs and diseases.
